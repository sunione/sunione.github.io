I am a second-year Master's student in the School of Electrical Engineering at **KAIST**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Jinseok Choi**](https://sic-x.kaist.ac.kr/professor). Currently, I am also collaborating with [**Prof. David J. Love**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/) at **Purdue University** as a visiting scholar.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **wireless communications**, **signal processing**, and **machine learning**. More recently, I have focused on solving estimation problems and am currently working on velocity estimation of targets in the near-field regime. In the past, I have conducted research on computer vision, local differential privacy (LDP), multiple access schemes such as SDMA and RSMA, and mismatch error estimation and compensation in time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs).
