Hello! I am a second-year Master's student in the School of Electrical Engineering at **KAIST**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Jinseok Choi**](https://sic-x.kaist.ac.kr/professor). Currently, I am also collaborating with [**Prof. David J. Love**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~djlove/) at **Purdue University** as a visiting scholar.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **wireless communications**, **signal processing**, and **machine learning**. I have focused on solving estimation problems and am currently working on velocity estimation of targets in the near-field regime. In the past, I have conducted research on topics such as:

- Image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Local differential privacy (LDP) in decentralized social networks
- Multiple access schemes such as SDMA and RSMA
- Mismatch error estimation and compensation in time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs)
